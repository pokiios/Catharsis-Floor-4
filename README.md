# Hi! Welcome to Catharsis: Floor 4

Catharsis: Floor 4 is a tower defence game based off of a section in a Dungeons & Dragons 5e session I played in. This game is made in Godot using the GDScript language, and is meant to server as an introduction into the engine!

**NOTE:** *A lot of my project as of now will be based off of [Wide Arch Shark's](https://www.youtube.com/@widearchshark3981) Godot tutorial for tower defence games, and I plan on expanding once my Godot knowledge has improved.*
